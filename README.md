# DumpLoad
This utility will take all you ISAM tables and Export them as CSV comma delimited files.
 The utility will also IMPORT them and restore your table with previous data. This will give you
 and additional way of saving data for backup and restore purposes in a TEXT like format.

Where this utility can become even more handy, is when you are doing conversions from ISAM to SQL.
 The part where you have to create a procedure to output all your table's data as a CSV file is done.
 You will still have to create the SQL backend table LOAD query script. That is dependent on your SQL
 backend and you will have to build that QUERY.
